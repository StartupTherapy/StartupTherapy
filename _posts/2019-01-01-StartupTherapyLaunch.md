title:  Startup Therapy Launch

#### Happy startupping in 2019!

On new year's day 2019 I decided to launch this website hoping it would help me go through my troubles starting startups and hoping it would help me make new frineds an build a small group of passionate not-so-jung-anymore fellow startuppers.

Me not being a coder, I launcehd it in the easiest possible way conceivable to a non coder:
- cheap domain name
- free hosting
- simple enough hack to get it to show up on Medium.com (thanks Pierre!)

It downed on me that by using GitHub Pages, I could have them handle all users and permisison problems and that this would help a lot along the line of letting other people jopin in and make this site a good icebraeker to start interesting and important conversations about the non-technical aspects of launching a startup. I learnded first hand that you can laways find a good book or tutorial on how to map-reduce your Javascript arrays, but that there lacks a good place where you can go and find confort when your cofounder leaves you, or when you partner starts to think you are somewhat insane for doing startups the gist of which you cannot explain. 

So, at the end, here is why you should read Startup Therapy, contribute to it and start a startup at the same time.
- Makes your life immediately better.
- Makes your startup immediately better.
- Makes you friends

This new year's day launch comes without much bells and wistles, not even pretty pictures in the episode posts. Meidum.com hack is still not implemented and contribution by anyone else but me is not yet figured out. Disqus plugin for comments is not implemented and the Jekyll theme is very basic.
You can alredy tell you are looking an an **MVP** themithycal Minimim Viable Product.
So, welcome into the magic world of startups!
Hope you get along for the fun ride and help me grow this into a small group of friends and maybe a community.

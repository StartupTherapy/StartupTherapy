# Welcome to Startup Therapy
## Launch startups and feeling good about it!

I begun launching startups as a remedy for middle life crisis since I could not afford the typical creature comforts of middle life, such as a multi-million dollar retirement found, a fast cabriolet and a nose job.

I am learning a lot, honing my skills, making new friends in the process and somehow growing younger at heart.

The experience is exhilarating and can really change your life for the better, irrespective of wether your startup ends up a precious unicorn or a working donkey, so I recommend you try it too!

I thought that writing about my newly discovered passion could have some benefits, and maybe encourage others to try, so I took to the internet and started this website to chronicle some episodes of my experience.
I conceived it as a collections of episodes, rather than chapters or blog posts, for the simple reason that it was the only way in which it would not feel like a chore or a recurring burden to me.
Also, I created this site to share my personal experience, but from the onset I felt I had to make it open for anybody who was looking for a community to belong to, so I felt that the episode format was the easiest way to leave space for creative freedom and non-linear storytelling.

If you recognise yourself as a "startupper" and want to contribute your story, whatever it is, I am more than happy to host it here.

The process is simple:
- Write your story
- Send me a Pull Request on GitHub

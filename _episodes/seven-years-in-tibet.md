##### When I look back it seems unbeliaveble that seven years have elapsed, but incredibly they passed in a blink.

The Calendar desn't lie. It's been seven years since the day I decided to venture into the startup world. Seven years spent ruminating about what to do and how to do it. An eternity, if you think of it. It felt like I was in trance, asleep, hipnotized. They say sleep deprivation does thta to people. It puts them in a state of half-life.

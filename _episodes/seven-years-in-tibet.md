#### When I look back it seems unbeliaveble that seven years have elapsed, but incredibly they passed in a blink.

The Calendar desn't lie. It's been seven years since the day I decided to venture into the startup world. Seven years spent ruminating about what to do and how to do it. An eternity, if you think of it. It felt like I was in trance, asleep, hipnotized. They say sleep deprivation does that to people. It puts them in a state of half-life. I can testify that is true!
Much of the sleep deprivation came from having three small children to care about, the other bit came from stressful daily work. Wherever it came from it was terrible.

At some point you start forgetting things, your mind is not sharp any more like it was before. Your mental processes come o a halt i an effort to preserve your gray matter. They say sleep deprivation is the torture of choice to persuade prisoners of Guantanamo to talk. I have no problem believing it.

Anyhow, the trebbling flame of startup fire survived. The ember was there, and in those seven years it had a long time to slowly burn to the core, shedding all that was not essential. All thoughts of funding rounds, pitchings, coferences died a slow death. Only passion remained, and a few ideas. What survived the seven years was in fact pure. Like in the best of the oriental mithology stories, the veil of deception was torn. I could see clearly at the end of it all.

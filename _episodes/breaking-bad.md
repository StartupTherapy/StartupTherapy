title: Breaking Bad
---
## I took Walter spitting blood into his handkerchief to break, it took me much less, fortunately.

I am sure everybody will recognise a moment in their lives when their view of the future suddenly changed.
Yes, the future; no, not the past or the present: the future.
See, the thing is that humans can endure incredible duress as long as they have a "tomorrow" to long for. As long as they can justify their situation as a "transition" to something else, they can go through pretty much anything.
The moment we loose sight of our final destination, no journey is worth, no place is comfortable or bearable, no situation is tolerable.
Because, let's admit it, the whole "live in the present" mindfulness idea is a great one-liner, but we have survived through millennia because we stocked grain for the winter, not because we ate it al in the summer under the "live-for-the-now" craze.
This is, in my opinion, what happened to Walter: he saw no future left for him and broke.
Now you migh say he borke bad and you don't see yourself starting criminal activities to ease out of your depression, and I could not agre more, in fact I decided to start a startup. Actually, multiple startups.

The exact day I might not remember, but I remember exactly what passed through my mind.
I was fighting with the design of some component of a filtering system of a waste incinerator draft and said: "What the hell, this is gonig nowhere".
By that i did not mean the design, or the waste incineration, which of course were totally fine, rather my life.
Yes, I know, it's a totally honest and well paying job designing stuff, it's just that it goes nowhere. The churn goes like this: you finish desingn your filtering station for one plant and then you go on to desesigning another filtering sation for another plant, and so forth. If you are lucky, you might end up designing an alkaline sulfur reducer, but that's it. Unitl you retire. If you ever retire under the current economy and circumstances.
So I thought I was hopeless and lost in a dead end alley of life. I stood up from my chair and went outside to get some fresh air.
At the time I had only one child, who had just been born, so I started looking at the blue sky in one of those Home Simpson moments in which you try to frame everything with the excuse that you have dependandts and cannot afford to quit your job or do anything crazy, and therefore sit out the opportuinty for change.
Wen I went back in, I had no desire to look at yet more blueprints and put on some Steve Jobs youtubes to try to project myself into him. This one was the one in which he says that "people no smarter than you created everything in this world".
Now I'd like you to apreciate that me having been trainde as an engineer it means I should be one of those people, so why did I not feel esthatic about the fact that Steve Jobs himself was using me as a subject of his thoughts?
Well, because it wwasn't! It was not referring to me, or to anybody else I knew, for taht matters because waht was important in his sentence, whch stood out to me as plain as the sun, wa that wha the really meant was "people no smater thatn me created everytihng "inteersting" in this world.
